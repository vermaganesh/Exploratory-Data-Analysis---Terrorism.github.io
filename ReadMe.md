Technical : Task 4 - Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism (Level - Intermediate)
Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Global Terrorism’

I will be doing this with the help of seaborn, plotly and folium libraries in python. Dataset can be found at : https://bit.ly/2TK5Xn5

What are we supposed to do with the given dataset?

As a security/defense analyst, we will try to find out the hot zone of terrorism. Also, what all security issues and insights can be derived by EDA.
